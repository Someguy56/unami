                            Your NAMI affiliate is asked to cover your travel and other expenses that you may incur to
                            attend this training.  Lodging is at the Comfort Inn, and is double occupancy.  If you
                            require single occupancy, arrangements will need to be made prior to attendance by the
                            attendee and there will be additional costs which will be the responsibility of the attendee.
                            In order to reserve a space a $50 refundable registration deposit from your affiliate is
                            required at the time of registration.  If you need to cancel after being accepted, notify
                            Deanna Roy at the state office 206-783-4288 or droy@namiwa.org no later than April 22, 2019
                            so we can fill your spot, or your affiliate will lose its $50 registration deposit.
                            Cancelled spots are filled with applications from the waiting list for the class, not by
                            sending another affiliate member.
