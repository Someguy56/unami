                            members/loved ones of someone living with a mental illness.  The FSG model offers a set of key
                            structures and group processes for facilitators to use in common support group scenarios.
                            These structures come with clear guidelines to follow.  Used together, they encourage full group
                            participation in support group meetings.  These structures are comfortable for both seasoned and
                            less experienced facilitators because they help support group function well in most every situation.

                            you may incur to attend this training.  Lodging is at the Comfort Inn, and is double occupancy.
                            If you require single occupancy, arrangements will need to be made prior to attendance by the
                            attendee and there will be additional costs which will be the responsibility of the attendee.
                            In order to reserve a space at the training, a $50 refundable registration deposit from your
                            affiliate is required at the time of registration.  If you need to cancel after being accepted,
                            notify Michelle Strait at the state office 206-971-1599 or mstrait@namiwa.org no later than
                            January 7, 2019 so we can fill your spot, or your affiliate will lose its $50 registration deposit.
                            Cancelled spots are filled with applications from the waiting list for the class, not by sending another affiliate member.
